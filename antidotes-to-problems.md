pp. 56-58, 61-63, 73-75

## Addition Tips

1. Recognize the results so far:
   - past success with meditation,
   - responding to past doubts, and,
   - positive affect on daily life, even when meditation does not go as desired or expected.
2. Acknowledge that doubt is not a special kind of thought.
   - Given *impermanence*, accept that this doubt too will pass.
   - Given *dependent origination*, you don't have direct control over doubting thoughts, so accept that you can't force yourself to overcome doubt. Suffering arises when you cling to the delusion that you have or should have more control than you do.
   - But note that you can exert some indirect control over doubt, namely insofar as you can change some of the conditions that cause it to arise: simply use your attention with conscious intention to give positive reinforcement to the mind to act differently.
   - I like to imagine the doubt as like a pet that won't do what you want: you can't force it do what you want but instead must change the conditions in which it is acting and give positive reinforcement for good behaviors.
   - Recognize how past conditioning & positive reinforcement has changed the mind gradually in just this way.
3. Reflect on motivations behind the doubt.
   - Acknowledge *craving* for doubt to go away.
   - Acknowledge *aversion* to the doubt.
   - Recognize that craving and aversion lie behind *expectation* for meditation to go a certain way and *impatience* that it's not going that way.
   - Reflect on the source of doubt: what more deeply is bothering you now that might explain why the doubt arose. For example, is there something going on your life where you have doubt, impatience, or a worry about losing control of the situation?
4. Acknowledge how doubt can be a good thing:
  - In daily life, it can serve useful functions, protecting you.
  - In meditation, it can be a sign of purification, revealing deeper motivations.
  - In meditation, it is a challenge from which you can learn.
  - It can be a sign of a deeper issue you are facing right now: so be glad to have had doubt bring this to your attention so that you can work on that deeper issue.
  - Have faith that you'll get through the doubt and be a stronger meditator as a result.
5. Recognize your limitations.
  - Accept that there is no "magical bullet" for overcoming doubt: you just have to use the tools available to you, such as redirecting attention and using positive reinforcement.
  - Remember that you can only have intentional control over attention: You can't control awareness!
  - Being anxious in response to the doubt won't change anything.
  - Suffering results from desiring to be in control of things, especially what's not in your control. So, let go of the craving to be in control.
6. Accept yourself and the situation.
  - You might have a lot of stressors right now, so it's natural to have negative emotions such as doubt arise: so have compassion toward yourself!
  - Recognize that conditions are impermanent so that these stressors will change, and with the change of conditions your meditation practice will always fluctuate.
  - Note that your mind is not special: other people have overcome self-doubt, and you can too!
  - The brain works in predictable ways: you just have to use the tools you have.
  - Recognize that your brain is stupid and just laugh at it!
7. Don't be in a hurry.
   - Accept that you will have setbacks with meditation, and they can vary in length from just a day to months to longer.
   - There is no need to be impatient and clinging to impatience will not help anything.
8. Recognizing all of the above outside of meditation practice, bring it with you in awareness to your meditation practice.
  - Just meditate and trust that results will come.
  - Within a meditation session, just observe the doubt with curiosity.
  - Don't desire to change it: acting on your aversion and resisting it only strengthens that aversion and the craving for things to be otherwise. In other words, if you try to resist, you'll activate the fight-or-flight response, which will undermine your conscious intentions.
  - You can "divide and conquer" (Shinzen Young): observe all the different sensations that accompany the doubt, e.g., within the body such as the chest or stomach.

## Very anxious thoughts

- Prior to meditating, write out briefly what is making you anxious so that you can come back to it later.
- Cf. Stage 4 on emotions.

## Song stuck in head

- recognize and acknowledge emotions and hindrances:
  - craving for meditation to go a particular way
  - expectation for meditation to go a particular way
  - aversion and resistance to the song
  - doubt about being able to meditate in that particular way
  - anxiety about the future meditation practice
- distinguish between whether the song is in attention or awareness
  - you can't control directly awareness, so just let the song be in the background of peripheral awareness; trying to control it will result in the song being in attention
  - all you can control directly is attention, so just use the techniques for directing attention back to the meditation object
- make the song / emotions about the song the meditation object of attention briefly
  - investigate it with curiosity and equanimity
  - pay attention to the details and concomitant emotions / feelings
- use labeling of "music"
- recognize that no effort will fix the situation, and effort will only give it energy
- finding the still point practice from stage 8
- work with the song
  - give the song a big, powerful ending
  - Listen to the entire song
  - use a cure tune, e.g., "Happy Birthday to You"
- pay attention to how the song arises, i.e., what precedes it
