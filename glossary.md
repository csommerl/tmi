    - sub-conscious

# Consciousness

- whatever we're experiencing in the moment (p. 19)
- attention + awareness (p. 19)

## attention

- Activities: isolates, analyzes, selects from awareness, homes in on, personal, focuses, singles out, interprets, discerns, reflects, judges, conceptual, abstract, translates, organizes, dominates consciousness, objects stand out from awareness, examines, scrutinizes, browses, concerned with the self, self-centered

- spontaneous movements of attention
  1. scanning
  2. getting captured
  3. alternating
- intentionally directed attention: attention is preceded by conscious intention to direct attention

## awareness

- Activities: open, inclusive, minimally conceptual, automatic, holistic, relational, contextual, filters, objective, background, peripheral, whole, captures, selects
- peripheral awareness (p. 21)
- 4 jobs (pp. 31-32)
  1. selection for attention, so that the latter can deeply analyze
  2. automatic responses, whereas attention deliberates
  3. objective perception of the world overall, whereas attention takes care of the self
  4. introspective perception of the mind overall and its activities

## Other

- background of conscious experience
  - peripheral awareness + subtle distractions (p. 96)
  - but elsewhere, this is associated with awareness primarily (p. 19)
- field of conscious awareness
  - objects of attention + objects of awareness (p. 19)

## Questions

- What is the distinction between awareness and unconsciousness? (p. 26)
  - When do we train one and not the other? (p. 27)

# Stable attention

- Cf. my notes in Practice Guide
  1. direct focus (Stages 2-3)
  2. sustain focus, or vigilance (Stage 4)
  3. control scope (Stages 6-8)
- focus of attention (p. 24)
  - object of attention (p. 24)
- direct focus of attention (p. 24)
  - achieved through conscious intentions (p. 27)
- scope of attention (p. 24)
- sustain focus of attention (p. 24)
  - achieved through *repeated* conscious intentions (p. 27)
- stable attention (p. 24)
- not the same as exclusive attention
  - TODO: how not?

Questions

- What's the difference between focus and scope? (p. 24)
  - how detailed?
  - do you alternate between whole and details (cf. p. 29)

# Types of Attention in the Stages

Cf. 6-8

The first Milestone suggests that you end Stage 3 with continuous attention, which suggests that you begin each stage with the type of attention stated in the Stage/Chapter title. But that doesn't fit with material elsewhere (pp. TODO).

## interrupted attention (Stage 2)

- pp. 7, 79-80
- Stage 2 goes from interrupted continuity of mind-wandering to interrupted continuity of attention (p. 80) => interrupted attention is the goal of Stage 2
  - the chapter title captures the end point? (unlike with below)
- Cf. p. 111
- Possibly: interrupted often by forgetting, but only rarely by mind-wandering?
  - thus, the meditation object leaves attention often but rarely leaves awareness

## extended continuity of attention (Stage 3)

- pp. 7
- Continuous attention is the goal of Stage 3.
  - the chapter title captures the starting point?
- Possibly: attention is only rarely interrupted by forgetting and even more rarely by mind-wandering?
  - thus, the meditation object almost never leaves awareness
- Something between interrupted and continuous?

## continuous attention (Stage 4)

- Continuous attention is the goal of Stage 3.
  - the chapter title captures the starting point?
- Possibly: attention is not interrupted by forgetting or mind-wandering?
  - the meditation object never leaves awareness or alternating attention (supported by p. 8 on beginning of Stage 4)

## exclusive attention

- no alternating
- Stage 6
- not the same as stable attention, which can be non-exclusive

## sustained exclusive focus of attention

# Distractions, Forgetting, and Mind-Wandering

Cf. pp. 26, 80, 96, 122, 162

## Distractions

A **distraction** is a sensation, feeling, emotion, or thought
  1. that arises in awareness, and,
  2. that attention alternates to and from.

### Subtle Distractions

A **subtle distraction** is a distraction that
  1. gets less alternating attention than the meditation object, and,
  2. primarily stay in the background of consciousness / awareness.

### Gross Distractions

A **gross distraction** is a distraction that
  1. gets more alternating attention than the meditation object, and,
  2. causes the meditation object to be (primarily) in awareness.

## Forgetting

Forgetting occurs when you
  1. no longer alternate attention to the meditation object, *and*,
  2. no longer have in awareness the intention to focus on the meditation object.

What counts as keeping an intention in awareness?
- Why does it seem easier to do this than keeping the breath itself in awareness?

Cf. pp. 80, 96, 122, 162

Add mention of distraction to definition?

Forgetting happens because:
  1. attention is so captured by a gross distraction that the meditation object leaves both (alternating) attention and awareness, or,
  2. attention alternates so frequently to a gross distraction that attention no longer alternates to the meditation object and then the meditation object leaves awareness.

## Mind-Wandering

Mind-wandering occurs when you
1. forget the meditation object due to a distraction, and
2. then get led to another distraction (due to a chain of association) (cf. p. 97).

Mind-wandering happens because:
  - attention alternates to a new distraction after forgetting

Does it occur if only one distraction is attended to?

## Waking Up

Waking up occurs when the unconscious part of the mind makes you consciously aware that you lost focus of attention on the meditation object.

# Mindfulness

To develop mindfulness:
1. permit awareness to do its job (e.g., filtering, recognizing, viewing things objectively), thereby allowing attention to focus on what's most important
2. develop raw mental power, by exercising sustaining close attention and strong awareness simultaneously

Mindfulness is achieved when
1. awareness is used effectively
2. you have enough conscious power
Thereby, awareness acts automatically, freeing attention to do its job and be calmer

How to evaluate these?
- strength
- sustain
- scope

Questions
- What role does the unconscious play in mindfulness? (p. 30)

## Levels of mindfulness

1. reactive mindfulness in context of daily life
   - you don't automatically follow unconscious conditioning or reactions (feelings, thoughts, etc.)
2. proactive mindfulness in context of daily life
   - you change unconscious conditioning, especially habits for reacting in unwholesome ways
   - but you don't change the deeper drives responsible for forming those habits
3. preventative mindfulness in meditation
   - you change deeper unconscious conditioning
   - especially drives, or deep-seated emotions and thoughts that motivate habits
4. transformative mindfulness with insight
   - you change your understanding of reality, which underlies your drives and motivations

# Other

- Discipline = form a firm, intentional resolve to let go of a distraction and return to the breath
- Diligence = exercise discipline consistently and promptly
