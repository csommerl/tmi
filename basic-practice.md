## Motivation

- formulate reminders

## Distractions

- external environment
- body

- current state of mind / quality of thoughts
- 5 hindrances

## Posture

## Expectations

# 4-Step Transition

- Optional fifth step at start: pay attention to current state of mind?
  - e.g., excitement or worry
- Don't control attention within each selected sphere of attention
- Use labeling?
- Seek out relaxing & pleasurable sensations
- mine: very anxious thoughts: write out a brief thing so that you can come back to it later

1. focus on the present
   - TODO
2. focus on bodily sensations
   - do deeper body scan? (No: conflicts with letting attention roam freely)
   - TODO
3. focus on bodily sensations related to the breath
   - TODO
4. direct attention to sensations of breathing at the nostrils
   - focus on the sensations, not concepts
   - don't force inhale and exhale to be the same length
   - don't follow breath as it goes into the body

Identify sense-objects and distinguish them from pleasure, pain, and motivational pulls (p. 49):
1. savor pleasure produced by sensations
2. acknowledge pain or unpleasantness produced by sensations, and then discard or let it go
3. distinguish motivational "pulls" of sensations (e.g., cravings or aversions) and discard them
   - is this getting too much into thoughts, which you're not supposed to engage with at this point?
