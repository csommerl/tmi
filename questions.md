## Introduction

- What is the difference between samatha and vipassana? (p. xxiii)
  - Cf. Shinzen Young's *Science of Enlightenment*, Chapter ?
- How are insights cognitive but not intellectual? (p. xxiv)

---

## An Overview of the Ten Stages

- Why do you have to do the stages in order without skipping if you can work on multiple stages at the same time? (p. 2)
- How to define interrupted, extended, and continuous attention (pp. 6-8)? See my glossary.
- Controlling the scope of attentions solidifies exclusive attention by excluding subtle distractions? (p. 10)
- What are "right intentions"? (p. 14)

## First Interlude

- In what sense is attention continuous and stable if it alternates? (p. 28)
- There is no explanation of what happens when attention doesn't do its job. So what happens in that case? (pp. 31-32)
- Do we train awareness or the unconscious? (p. 31)
  - awareness: pp. 31
  - unconscious: pp. 27
- How do we use awareness more effectively? (p. 35, cf. p. 37)

## Stage One: Establishing a Practice

- In step one of the Transition, should reactions such as craving, aversion, etc. be acknowledged as such? (p. 49)

---

## Stage Two: Interrupted Attention and Overcoming Mind-Wandering

- The characterization of forgetting is that the breath is "abandoned" (p. 81). That suggests that forgetting can happen simply when the breath is lost from attention but still in awareness. But p. 122 suggests that forgetting happens only when the meditation object is lost from awareness too.
- Is the "aha" really introspective awareness, or is it introspective attention? (p. 82)
  - Or is the idea that introspective awareness as a faculty is responsible for the "aha", which then immediately is attended to?
  - But is it introspective awareness that does this, or is it the unconscious, as he says at the top of p. 82?
- *He says that you shouldn't try to limit peripheral awareness: how is that to be done? (p. 87)*
  - Checking in, as discussed later?

---

## Stage Three: Extended Continuity of Attention and Overcoming Forgetting

- What is the distinction between extended continuity of attention and continuous attention? (p. 95)
- In the description of Stage 3, what are the 3 intentions? (p. 95, cf. p. 15)
  1. intend to invoke introspective attention frequently before forgetting or dozing off
  2. intend to make corrections when you notice distractions or dullness
  3. intend to sustain peripheral awareness while attending to the breath as closely as possible
- Here "background" is defined as subtle distractions + awareness (p. 96). Earlier, the background of consciousness was identified with peripheral awareness (p. 19). How can these characterizations be reconciled in order to define distractions?
- How do you distinguish between having a (gross) distraction with the meditation object in the background and forgetting the meditation object? (p. 97)
- *Culadasa says that "it's very important to also maintain extrospective awareness", but how is that done? (p. 99)*
  - He says later that you've worked on extrospective awareness, but again without explanation of how. (pp. 101)
  - Checking in?
- Do my reminders function as self-talk that could cause problems? (pp. 101)
- What counts as appropriate labels? (p. 102)
  - Should reactions such as craving, aversion, etc. be acknowledged with the appropriate labels?
- When should labeling be used? (p. 102)
  - The text here (p. 102) lists after enjoying the "aha" moment, but should it also be used before forgetting happens (cf. p. 104)?
- *What is correcting? (p. 104)*
  - See Stage 4.
- *What is meant by "tighten up attention/focus on the breath"? (p. 104)*
  - See [What methods are you using for tightening focus?](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMindIlluminated/comments/72slhh/what_methods_are_you_using_for_tightening_focus/)
- *What is the difference between subtle dullness and strong dullness? (p. 109)*
- How do you expand awareness to include the body or the external environment? How do you expand awareness to become all-encompassing with the breath secondary? (p. 110)

## Third Interlude: How Mindfulness Works

- Is the personality a set of behaviors or also the drives that lead to those behaviors? (p. 117)

---

## Stage Four: Continuous Attention and Overcoming Gross Distraction and Strong Dullness

- *How to deal with a distraction that suddenly becomes gross and threatens to cause forgetting?*
- Isn't "tightening up focus on the breath" a way of using brute force, which p. 123 says we shouldn't do? (p. 124)
- TODO

## Fourth Interlude: The Moments of Consciousness Model

- Earlier, the book has emphasized that attention and awareness exist together at the same time on, so to speak, two separate tracks (e.g., as foreground and background). But the model here presents moments of attention and moments of awareness as being together on the same track. This seems to reduce them both to being the same kind of thing. My impression is that attention and awareness are supposed to still be fundamentally different kinds of things. So what to make of all this? (p. 153)
